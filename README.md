Overview
---------
Becoming SiFu is a Virtual Reality action game with motion tracking techniques. The story takes place in the year 5680, where the ancient wisdom of Kung Fu is about to be lost in history. The player, as the last apprentice in the Shaolin Dojo, will be asked to master the various martial arts moves to become a real SiFu. 

The main game mechanism is about matching poses that incoming enemies are performing within a time limit. The player will be standing in a circle and enemies will approach the player in Kung Fu postures with various speeds. When an enemy enters the circle, the player needs to match their pose as accurately as possible and as fast as possible to combat the enemy. Based on how accurately and how fast the pose is matched, the player will earn some scores. The goal is to survive all waves of enemies before the health is deducted to zero because of mis-matching poses. 

The pose match is evaluated by collision detection between the hand controllers/ foot trackers, and the reference balls of body parts around the player. If a tracking device is inside a refernce ball, the match for that particular body part will be counted as successful.  If the player is unable to match all the body parts within the time limit for a pose, their health will be deducted by some points. Whenever the health level is reduced to zero, the player loses the game. The player will have 3 chances to heal themselves by performing a unique pose.

The target audience will be people who are interested in VR, and people who want to do physical exercises in a more entertaining way. As the postures are based on Kung Fu Panda, this game has potential to be useful for people who really want to learn Kung Fu. Additionally, from a future marketing perspective, the set of poses can be extended to other martial arts like Kenjutsu and Karate, which may attract a more global audience.

This game is developed with HTC Vive Pro and Vive Trackers. The development process took about 5 weeks with a talented team of 3 game developers working around the clock to ensure the best output for our loyal players.
